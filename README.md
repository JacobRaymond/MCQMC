# MCQMC
Code to support my master's research on Markov Chain quasi-Monte Carlo methods for term structure model parameter estimation.

## Proofs of Concept
MCMC.jl: A simple Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in Julia, as a proof of concept.

GibbsPoC.jl: An implementation of the second example from "A quasi-Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm" by Owen and Tribble (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0409596102). Consists in a Gibbs sampler incorporation RQMC points.
